          The Saronic Gulf or Gulf of Aegina in Greece is formed between the
          peninsulas of Attica and Argolis and forms part of the Aegean Sea. It
          defines the eastern side of the Isthmus of Corinth, being the eastern
          terminus of the Corinth Canal, which cuts across the isthmus. The
          Saronic Islands in the gulf have played a pivotal role in the history
          of Greece, with the largest, Salamis, naming a significant naval
          battle in the Greco-Persian wars. The Megara Gulf makes up the
          northern end of the Saronic Gulf.

          The Battle of Salamis, just to the west of modern-day Piraeus, took
          place in the Saronic Gulf. This naval battle off Salamis Island saw
          the Athenians defeat Xerxes, assuring Aigaleo its place as the cradle
          of modern European culture. The ancient port of Cenchreae used to be
          situated here.

          The Saronic Islands or Argo-Saronic Islands is an archipelago in
          Greece, named after the Saronic Gulf in which they are located, just
          off the Greek mainland. The main inhabited islands of this group are
          Salamis, Aegina, Agistri, and Poros. The islands of Hydra and Dokos,
          which lie off the northeast tip of the Peloponnese, are sometimes
          included as part of the Saronic Islands.

          The Ionian Sea is an elongated bay of the Mediterranean Sea. It is
          connected to the Adriatic Sea to the north, and is bounded by Southern
          Italy, including Calabria, Sicily, and the Salento peninsula to the
          west, southern Albania (and western Apulia, Italy) to the north, and
          the west coast of Greece, including the Peloponnese. All major islands
          in the sea, which are located in the east of the sea, belong to
          Greece. They are collectively named the Ionian Islands.

          The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea
          between Europe and Asia. It is located between the Balkans and
          Anatolia, and covers an area of some 215,000 square kilometres. In the
          north, the Aegean is connected to the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea by
          the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands
          are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern
          periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. The sea reaches a maximum depth
          of 2,639m to the west of Karpathos. The Thracian Sea and the Sea of
          Crete are main subdivisions of the Aegean Sea.

          The current coastline dates back to about 4000 BC. Before that time,
          at the peak of the last ice age (about 18,000 years ago) sea levels
          everywhere were 130 metres lower, and there were large well-watered
          coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were
          first occupied, the present-day islands including Milos with its
          important obsidian production were probably still connected to the
          mainland. The present coastal arrangement appeared around 9,000 years
          ago, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000
          years after that.
