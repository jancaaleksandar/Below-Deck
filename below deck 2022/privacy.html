          the end-date of the charter period, exclusively at the designated
          ports. The chartered yacht has to have returned to its end-port by

        <p class="privacy-text">
          It is required by the Greek Port Authorities that at least two
          passengers of a bareboat yacht charter are certifiably qualified to
          navigate sailing yachts at open seas. However, in case only one
          passenger qualifies as such, the Port Authority will accept a formal
          written statement by a second passenger, that he/she carries open-sea
          experience (no proof will be required).

        <h2 class="privacy-subheading">Terms of Payment</h2>
        <p class="privacy-text">
          In order the charter-party to be valid, an advance payment equal to
          50% of its total value has to be made to Bellow Deck upon its signing.
          The remaining 50% will be payable 45 days before the start-date of the
          charter period, at the latest. It is noted that, in case a Charter
          Contract is signed regarding a charter period starting within the
          following 45 days or less, it has to be paid in full upon its signing.
          Before embarking on the boat, the client will provide Bellow Deck with
          a refundable deposit - in cash or credit card Visa/Master – intended
          to cover the cost for any loss or damage to the boat while on charter.
          The deposit is returned in full at the end of the charter period in
          case there is no damage or loss. Otherwise, the relevant cost is
          deducted from the deposit and the client will receive the balance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="privacy-subheading">Charter Booking Procedure</h2>
        <p class="privacy-text">
          Upon deciding to actually book a charter proposed by Bellow Deck, the
          client has to formally request an option (right) of booking for the
          specific boat, ports and dates of interest, which can only be offered
          for a few days. It is during this short period of time that the client
          will have to book the charter and settle the advance payment, after
          having finalized all details pertaining to the intended sailing
          holiday along with the other participants of his/her group.
        </p>
        <p class="privacy-list-heading">
          A charter booking will not be considered valid and final, unless the
          client:

              he/she will have previously received electronically (via email).

            <li class="privacy-list">
              Has sent to Bellow Deck, proof of payment of the advance payment
              mentioned earlier (50% of the total value of the Charter
              Contract).
            </li>
            <li class="privacy-list">
              The Charter Contract will finally be considered valid upon payment
              of the remaining 50% of its total value, 45 days before the
              beginning of the charter period, at the latest.
            </li>

        </div>
        <h2 class="privacy-subheading">Cancellation Terms</h2>
        <p class="privacy-list-heading">
          In case a booked yacht charter needs to be cancelled on the client's
          initiative, the following terms will apply, as described in the
          Memorandum of Charter:

              withheld by Bellow Deck. If the advanced payment is more than 30%,
              the extra amount will be credited to the next charter. In case the
              yacht is booked by another client, and under the same conditions
              only an administrative fee of 300€ will be held.
            </li>
            <li class="privacy-list">
              46 - 90 days prior to embarkation: 50% of the total charter fee is
